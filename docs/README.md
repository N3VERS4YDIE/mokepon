## Usage

To run the Mokepon project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download and extract the ZIP archive.

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project's root directory.

3. **Build the project:** Before you can run the project, you need to transpile the TypeScript code into JavaScript. You can do this using either of the following methods:

   - Using npm:

     ```bash
     npm install   # Install project dependencies
     npm run build # Transpile TypeScript to JavaScript
     ```

   - Using the TypeScript Compiler (tsc):

     ```bash
     npm install -g typescript  # Install TypeScript globally (if not done already)
     tsc                        # Transpile TypeScript to JavaScript
     ```

4. After the build process completes successfully, you can now open the project in your web browser.

   - Navigate to the `src` directory and open the `index.html` file in your preferred browser.
   - Alternatively, you can set up a local server using tools like `live-server` or `http-server`, and access the project through the server's URL.

5. You should now see the Mokepon application running in your browser. Interact with the app and explore the interactive animations!
